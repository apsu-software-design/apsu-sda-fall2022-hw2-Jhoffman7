# The Gathering Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "Gatherings" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> With the first assignment of the class I determined which class depended on what, and from there I determined which classes would be responsible for what. For example, I determined that Gatherings would be composed of Gathering, Members would be composed of Member, Organizations would be composed of Organization where each of the singular form of these contained the constructor and the getters/setters. I also had stopped by Dr.Church to run my idea past him to see if he thought it was plausible.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I did get most of my help from Dr.Church because I was so lost on where to start with the assignment, but with his guidance I was able to push through and really figure out what needed to get done.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> This assignment took me around 16 hours spread across two days, because I was goober and completely forgot the assignment existed.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> This assignment was a solid 7 


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I didn't have much experience in command line programming assignments so I was confused on how to actually test the code and how to properly go about compiling it. In the end I had asked Dr.Church for clarification and it sorted out my problem immediately!
